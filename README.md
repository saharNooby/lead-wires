![Preview](https://saharnooby.me/download/preview.png?uuid=51da1969-48a3-42ef-82c1-6488a15af590)

Download: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/saharNooby/lead-wires/releases)

[SpigotMC plugin page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/leadwires.76515/)

## Build

To build, you need:
- Maven
- JDK 8
- `buildSettings.properties` file with `outputDir` property set to path where you want the JAR to appear

`git clone` the repository, `cd` into its dir and run `mvn clean install`.

## Using as an API

The plugin allows you to create and remove wires programmatically, so you or your developers can implement some awesome ideas like electricity, power poles, etc.

### Adding as a dependency

First, you need to build this plugin using instructions above.

Then, you need to add the plugin as a Maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>me.saharnooby.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>lead-wires</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.11</version>
</dependency>
```

Alternatively, you can just download plugin from SpigotMC and link it yourself.

Add to your `plugin.yml`: `depend: ['LeadWires']` so Spigot will know to load your plugin after LeadWires.

To get an API instance, call `me.saharnooby.plugins.leadwires.LeadWires.getApi()`.
